#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process where software is created by means of writing code to solve real-world problems through building platforms like apps, websites and games. Software engineers plan, design, build, test, and fix software step by step to make sure it works well and solves the problem it's meant to solve. This is important in the technology industry because it helps create software that is reliable and doesn't easily crash. It also saves time and money because planning ahead helps avoid big mistakes. Software engineering makes sure that software is safe from hackers and keeps users' information protected. It also makes it easier to improve or add new features when companies grow

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

In the late 1960s Structured Programming was introduced, it wqas created to improve the reliability and clarity of programs. Program flow was restricted to three main structures. This simplification of programming in turn made programs that are primarily independent from each other. Making systems easier to read and debug.

In the late 1970s The Waterfall model was introduced planning, designing and testing of software engineering. At its core it is a sequential model that requires engineering to follow procedures step by step.

The 1980s ushered in Object-Oriented Programming where each data structure is organised defined with its own attributes and procedures to make code easier to use, reuse and maintain.

The 1990s introduced Agile development which focused on flexibility, to allow for software to be continnually worked on with collabortive efforts.

In this era Version Control systems were also introduced - whuch further enhanced the collaborative model established by Agile development. Version control systems not only aided collboration but also aid with tracking changes of code.

Then in the early 2000s, cloud computing was introduced, this allowed users to scale applications and store data remotely, reducing the need for physical infrastructure and supporting features like continuous integration and deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1)Planning: This is where we figure out what the software needs to do, how long it will take, and what resources are needed. It's about setting goals and figuring out the overall plan for the project.

2)Feasibility Study: In this phase, we check if the project is possible. We look at things like whether it's technically possible to build, if it's affordable, and if it will meet the users' needs.

3)Design: Here, we plan how the software will be built. We figure out the structure and decide on the details of how it will work and look.

4)Implementation (Coding): In this phase, developers start writing the code based on the design. It's when the actual software starts taking shape.

5)Testing: After the software is built, we test it to make sure it works correctly. We look for any bugs or problems and fix them to make sure the software works as expected.

6)Deployment: Once testing is done, the software is released and made available for users to use.

7)Maintenance: After the software is out there, we continue to update it and fix any issues that come up. We also add new features to keep the software running smoothly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology is a linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It’s best for projects with clear, fixed requirements that are unlikely to change, such as government projects or systems with strict guidelines.

Agile, on the other hand, is flexible and iterative, focusing on small cycles or sprints. It allows for regular feedback and changes throughout development, making it ideal for projects where requirements may evolve, like a startup app where user feedback is key.

In short, Waterfall works well for predictable, structured projects, while Agile is better for dynamic projects that need flexibility and ongoing improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools in the software development process, each playing a critical role in improving efficiency and collaboration.

An IDE is a software application that provides developers with a comprehensive environment to write, test, and debug code. It typically includes features like code completion, syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and integrated version control, making coding more efficient and reducing the likelihood of errors. IDEs help developers write code faster and with fewer bugs, as they can see issues in real-time. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, which is widely used for web development, and IntelliJ IDEA, which is popular for Java development.

On the other hand, a Version Control System (VCS) is used to manage changes to a codebase over time. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate on code, and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. VCS ensures that all developers working on a project can work in parallel without interfering with each other’s work. It also provides a history of changes, which is crucial for debugging and understanding the evolution of the project. Git is the most commonly used VCS, and platforms like GitHub or GitLab are used to host and manage repositories, enabling easy collaboration among teams.

Together, IDEs and VCS are vital for managing complex software projects. IDEs help developers write and test code efficiently, while VCS ensures smooth collaboration and tracks the history of code changes, helping to avoid conflicts and keep the project organized.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Dealing with complex requirements: Requirements can be unclear or change frequently.
  Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to adapt to changes and gather regular feedback from stakeholders.
  
Debugging and troubleshooting: Bugs and unexpected behavior in code.
  Strategy: Use automated testing, debugging tools, and write clean, modular code.
  
Managing time and deadlines: Pressure to meet deadlines can lead to stress.
  Strategy: Practice effective time management, break the project into smaller tasks, and maintain clear communication with the team.
  
Maintaining code quality and consistency: Ensuring high-quality, consistent code in large teams.
  Strategy: Implement code reviews, use coding standards, and adopt continuous integration practices.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: This is the most basic level of testing, where individual components or functions of the software are tested in isolation. Unit tests check if a specific part of the code behaves as expected.

Integration Testing: After unit testing, integration testing checks how different components or modules work together. It focuses on the interactions between units, ensuring they communicate and function properly when combined.

System Testing: This type of testing checks the entire software system as a whole. It verifies that all components and features of the software work together as expected, often using real-world scenarios.

Acceptance Testing: This is typically the final testing phase before the software is released to users. It verifies whether the software meets the business requirements and if it is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of creating and improving the questions or instructions you give to an AI model to get the best possible answers. It’s about making sure the way you ask something is clear and specific so the AI understands what you want and gives you useful responses.

Prompt engineering is important because it helps improve how we interact with AI. If the prompt is well-written, the AI is more likely to give you the right answer. If the prompt is unclear or vague, the AI might misunderstand and give a wrong or irrelevant answer. By carefully designing prompts, you can make the AI more helpful for tasks like writing content, solving problems, or answering questions, making sure it works better for your needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: How can I improve my website?

Improved Prompt: What are three specific ways I can improve the loading speed of my website?

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and focuses on a particular aspect of the website (loading speed). It also asks for a set number of suggestions (three), which makes it easier for the AI to provide a focused and actionable response. The vague prompt, on the other hand, is too general and could lead to a broad or unrelated answer about website improvement.
